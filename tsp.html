    <p>
      The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) tries to find the shortest path through a given graph, touching every point and returning to the starting position.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is an NP-hard problem, and finding the best solution efficiently is one of the great challenges of Computer Science.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      At Zillabyte, we like hard problems.  We also like helping sales people.  Can you implement a better solution to the TSP than we have here? If so, email your implementation (or a link) to <a href="mailto:jobs@zillabyte.com">jobs@zillabyte.com</a>
